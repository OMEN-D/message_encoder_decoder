# message_encoder_decoder
I simple message encoder/decoder using base64 encryption and a simple GUI via tkinter

I am not good with colors so I just added the colors I liked at the moment they can be changed from 'bg_color' and 'fg_color' variables.
Feel free to use this to encrypt your messages if you are sharing some sensitive information or don't want someone else to know, make sure you don't tell them you are using base64 encoding ;)
